Can't seem to reach Alex or Tru by text so if you guys read this please get back to me. I have the
the project at the point where the memory trace is going to work, but only with one CPU. Having
worked on this I've realized that we need to redesign the program a bit. So I'm gonna leave it at
this for today, and work on it tomorrow morning. I don't know how much time I'll have tomorrow or
Sunday, but I'll have a few hours in the morning to work on it. Getting multiple CPUs to work is
the hard part, and is why I think we need to change a few things about how we're going about with
the program. I started working on MainSystem, however I'm going to scrap it because it's really
messy.

I didnt get the group texts, but i did get the individual texts. Let me know which part to focus on.
I suggest we make up a TO-DO list with everything that needs doing, and everything that is already done
so that we dont step on each other's toes.
EDIT- Just read over vitaliy's work. HOLY FUCK. You are a genius. So beautiful.

Lol it's gonna be tough to get multiple CPUs to work though with the way it's done right now. So we
have to make some changes on how the Caches interface with the CPUs and the System. I'm working on
something that I'll upload shortly.
