Classes:
CPU - responsible for calling memory read/write operations
Cache - responsible for returning/fetching the contents of memory
System - responsible for calling CPU to execute instructions (in this case memory accesses)
Main program - user front end that controls the System instance

CPU:
+ L1 Instruction Cache
+ L1 Data Cache
+ L2 Cache
- boolean readMemory(int location)
- boolean writeMemory(int location, int data)

Cache:
+ int referenceCounter
+ int misses
- boolean locate(int location)
- void fetch(int location)

System:
+ List of the CPUs
+ L3 Cache
+ MESI Indicator for the L3 Cache
- void traceMemory(List<Integer> traceList)
- toString()

Main program:
loads memory trace file
tell System read/write based on trace file
print summary after System is done
