Can't seem to reach Alex or Tru by text so if you guys read this please get back to me. I have the
the project at the point where the memory trace is going to work, but only with one CPU. Having
worked on this I've realized that we need to redesign the program a bit. So I'm gonna leave it at
this for today, and work on it tomorrow morning. I don't know how much time I'll have tomorrow or
Sunday, but I'll have a few hours in the morning to work on it. Getting multiple CPUs to work is
the hard part, and is why I think we need to change a few things about how we're going about with
the program. I started working on MainSystem, however I'm going to scrap it because it's really
messy.

I didnt get the group texts, but i did get the individual texts. Let me know which part to focus on.
I suggest we make up a TO-DO list with everything that needs doing, and everything that is already done
so that we dont step on each other's toes.
EDIT- Just read over vitaliy's work. HOLY FUCK. You are a genius. So beautiful.

Lol it's gonna be tough to get multiple CPUs to work though with the way it's done right now. So we
have to make some changes on how the Caches interface with the CPUs and the System. I'm working on
something that I'll upload shortly.

Ok, sounds good. Any word from tru or andy?

I talked to Andy yesterday, but haven't heard anything from Tru at all. We should figure out a better 
way of talking, using a text file on github is kinda awkward lol.

Unfortunately, With my shitty phone coverage, this is the best way to gaurentee i see a message. That, and it leaves a paper 
showing we tried contacting tru. I hope he's okay. So i just tryed submitting a change, and it said you had modified the 
file i was changing, so my changes were made into a branch. They were mostly just javadocs anyways, but if you see
the new branch, thats what thats about. I dont know how to merge them, or even if its worth it since everything is changed anyway.

I'm gonna go ask my bro if we can use his IRC server, I'll let you know in a bit. About that, I saw your changes,
the reason why it said that is because I changed the Cache class, and I committed after you changed the Memory class.
So it merged my changes to Cache and your changes to Memory into a single repository. Your changes to Memory should still be
there, as well as my changes to Cache.

Nvm I set up a server on freenode, the channel is called cache
