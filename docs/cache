offset: number of hex digits=cache line size in bytes / 16
        number of bits=cache line size in bytes / 4
        when you truncate the offset off the int of the memory address, it's equivalent to dividing the address by 2^(bits truncated)
assumed associativity = 2 way
bits needed for n-way associative index = log base 2 of n
the rest of the bits are used for tag

to truncate offset: shift right n / 4
if a > 1 {
    index = location & !(0xFFFFFFFF << Math.log(a)/Math.log(2));
    // find first unused block in the set indicated by the index
    // if no free block found replace via LRU

} Else {
index = location & !(0xFFFFFFFF << Math.log(cache lines)/Math.log(2));
// just replace whatever pointed by index
}
